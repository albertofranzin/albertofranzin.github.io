<li>9:00 - 9:05 Alberto Franzin: Introduction</li>
<li>9:05 - 10:00 Andreagiovanni Reina: The power of inhibition for collective decision making in minimalistic robot swarms (invited talk)
<p><b>Abstract</b>: I investigate how large groups of simple robots can reach a consensus with decentralised minimalistic algorithms. Simple robots can be useful in nanorobotics and in scenarios with low-cost requirements. I show that through decentralised voting algorithms, swarms of minimalistic robots can make best-of-n decisions. In my research, I show that using a biologically-inspired voting model based on inhibitory signals, the swarm can collectively perform better and be more resilient against a minority of misbehaving robots than in models without inhibition. Our best-of-n decision algorithm can also be used for collective environmental monitoring. I will show that investigating these models can be very interesting and lead to surprising results. As Anderson said in 1972, More Is Different. In our analysis, we found that in a range of relevant conditions, limiting the communication range or the speed of the robots can improve collective performance. We explain the mechanisms of some of these phenomena with a combination of mathematical models and large-scale robot experiments.</p>
<p><b>Short Bio</b>: Andreagiovanni Reina received an MSc degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and a PhD degree in applied sciences from IRIDIA, Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. He was a research fellow at the University of Sheffield, UK, from 2015 to 2020. Andreagiovanni is currently a Research Fellow in collective behaviour at the Interdisciplinary Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IRIDIA) of the Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles, funded by the Belgian F.R.S.-FNRS as a Charg&eacute; de Recherches. He has been a researcher in seven European projects on distributed robotic systems since 2009.</p>
